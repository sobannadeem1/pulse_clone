        <h1>How RealtyNinja Uses Pulse to Avoid Stress About Cash Flow</h1>

        <h3>Tell us about yourself and your business.</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Casimir Loeber and I am co-founder of RealtyNinja. We are a

        <h3>What were the reasons that lead you to start using Pulse?</h3>
        <p>
          As most entrepreneurs will know, there are never enough hours in the
          day to do the work that pays the bills, let alone the behind the
          scenes work most of us hate to do. Both my business partner and myself
          knew from the beginning that we were not the accountant types or even
          good bookkeepers. What we did know how to do was preserve the paper
          trail and plug numbers into websites. This lead us to pulse which
          allowed us to visualize our cash flow before our brains turned to snow
          with receipts, spread sheets and accordion folders.
        </p>

        <p>
          If we have a large prospect on the horizon we take 2 seconds to put it
          in Pulse to see how it effects us; simple as that.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Describe how you use Pulse and how it fits within your accounting
          workflow.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Before we had a bookkeeper we would simply export our invoice totals
          from our invoicing system (Freshbooks!) and enter these values as
          income in pulse. We were pretty good with our expense paper trails and
          would just go through our credit card and cheque book for these
          values. As things started to ramp up and consume more time, we hired a
          bookkeeper and gave her the keys to our pulse account. She was able to
          pick it up in no time and now all we do is log in every couple of days
          to see where we are, where we are headed and where we came from. If we
          have a large prospect on the horizon we take 2 seconds to put it in
          pulse to see how it effects us; simple as that.
        </p>

        <h3>What do you like most about Pulse?</h3>
        <p>
          What I like most about pulse is that it turns something that is very
          number heavy and hard to visualize into something that is easy to look
          at. I can take a quick look at my Pulse account and see exactly where
          we miscalculated on a quote and how long it took us to recover from
          that. The reporting functionality is definitely the strong point with
          pulse and has the potential to be expanded in many great directions.

        <h3>How has Pulse helped your business?</h3>
        <p>
          Pulse has taken the fear and stress out of cash flow projection and
          management. It has seriously made it so that I can sleep better
          knowing that I am not going to randomly run out of cash tomorrow. It
          is easy to learn and easy to teach, so integrating it into our
          workflow was not an issue at all.
        </p>

        <h3>Is there anything else you’d like to add?</h3>
        <p>
          I want to say 2 last things. The first being that seeing the blue line
          climb upwards and the green bars tower over the red, makes me want to
          dance. Secondly, I can’t wait to see what the people at Pulse will
          cook up next.
